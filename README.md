# Sassy Buttons

Simple set of CSS3 buttons written in sass. Example on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1609885-CSS-Buttons).

## Using Sassy Buttons

Include in your sass and update the variables as you please.

* `$sb-btn-color` is the main background colour of your button
* `$sb-btn-text-color` is the colour of your text inside the button
* `$sb-btn-radius` is the size of the border radius you would like to apply

## Vendor Prefixes

This assumes you use some sort of autoprefixer on your sass files. It has some already for the background gradients to manually support more browsers, like the different implementations of gradients in webkit.
